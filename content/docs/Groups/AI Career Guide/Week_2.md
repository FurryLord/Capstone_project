## Tech Stack Selection
1. Programming languages:
     - Python for ML and back-end part
     - JavaScript for front-end part
     - SQL for databases
2. Frameworks:
     - React for front-end part
     - FastAPI for bulding API's with Python
     - Airflow for monitoring workflows
     - Scrapy for Web Scraping
3. Technologies:
     - Web Scraping for vacancies searching
     - OpenAI for interaction with ChatGPT queries
     - PostgreSQL for databases
     - Docker
## Architecture Design
1. Component Breakdown:
2. Data Management:
3. User Interface (UI) Design:
4. Integration and APIs:
5. Scalability and Performance: 
6. Security and Privacy:
7. Error Handling and Resilience:
8. Deployment and DevOps:
    - We will use GitLab as version control and for CI/CD. The app will be deployed as a Kubernetes cluster of Docker containers.
## Week 2 questionnaire
1. Tech Stack Resources:
    - We don't use any project-based books.
2. Mentorship Support:
    - We don't have any mentor.
3. Exploring Alternative Resources: 
We checked different solutions with simular functionality:
    - [AI Roadmap Generator](https://ai-roadmap.com/) for creating career path roadmap
    - Professional orientation tests ([this](https://www.careerexplorer.com/career-test/) and [this](https://www.123test.com/career-test/)) for exploring possible questions to apply based on their results OpenAI query.
4. Identifying Knowledge Gaps:
   - Our team have knowlegde gaps in prompt engineering with usage of OpenAI API, Scrapy. So, we will deal with it by self-learning.
5. Engaging with the Tech Community:
   - We search for information on forums dedicated for specifics topics to get rid of knowledge gaps (for example, formatting of responses from ChatGPT)
6. Learning Objectives: 
    We set up following tasks in Trello for current week:
    - Create repository structure.
    - Create prototype of UX/UI design.
    - Create pipeline in Airflow.
    - Learn OpenAI API.
    - Collect questions for professional orientation test
7. Sharing Knowledge with Peers: 
    - We have Tech Lead in each team (Front-end, Back-end, ML) who is responsible for sharing knowlegde.
8. We used ChatGPT to expedite the process of acquiring knowledge.
## Tech Stack and Team Allocation
